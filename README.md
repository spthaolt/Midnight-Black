Midnight Black
=========
Quite a while ago, I found this great jPlayer skin on GitHub. It was nice, simple, and great looking! But what I soon found out was that it was only for jPlayer 2.0.0. That got me thinking, "Hey! Why don't I update it?!". And I did just that!

It actually ended up looking pretty good :D

This skin was originally created by [persand](https://github.com/persand). He made it for jPlayer 2.0.0 and I simply updated the CSS and added a few more images. I only take 40% credit for this work.

The orginal theme for jPlayer 2.0.0 can be found here - https://github.com/persand/jPlayer-skins
